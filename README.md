Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

index.html contains the main page with links to 3 other pages:
  gardening.html
  tv.html
  reading.html
Also on the main page is a bootstrap grid structure containing 4 labeled images.
The grid structure specifies that for large screens there should be 4 images
across and for small screens there should be 2 images across.

gardening.html contains a table of some of my favorite plants in the rows
and features of those plants in the columns. There is also a link to go back
to the main page.

tv.html contains an ordered list of links to some of my favorite TV series.
There is also a link to go back to the main page.

reading.html contains an unordered list of links to some recommended books
I've read recently.

Each page has a different cover background, but in each case, when the window
is made smaller, the background changes to same pattern.

styles.scss contains my sass style sheet which has been converted to
styles.css.

There are several images used.
